# Route-Mapping-and-Location-Tracking
Optimizing Route Mapping and Location Tracking Using Graph Plotting on Latitude-Longitude Coordinates
This project is a simple and effective CAPTCHA generator built using Python. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Tkinter module, making generating and displaying CAPTCHA images easy. The primary aim is to provide a straightforward tool for generating CAPTCHA challenges to enhance security on websites and applications.
## Learnings

- **Folium Module:**
  1) Learned to create interactive maps using the Folium module in Python.
  2) Generated maps as separate HTML files.
  3) Embedded and hosted these HTML maps using Python's web browser module.
